 * ============================= README ============================= *
 * Compare the execution times for sorting large arrays of integers
 * with insertionsort and merge sort.
 * <p>
 * Todo for assignment 5:
 * [X] compare insertion sort VS Merge sort for random arrays
 * [] Explain the code and how execution time was measured,
 *    and why the presented results are valid.
 * ========================= Solution =================================
 *
 *
 *
 * ====================== Questions to answer ======================= *
 * <Question> How was execution time measured ? </Question>
 * <Answer>
 * Every implementation of the Sort interface has a time(arr[]) method
 * that returns the time that i took to sort the array in milliseconds.
 *
 * It internally uses an implementation of the StopWatchI interface
 * which will return the elapsed time.
 *
 * Execution time is measured for one problem size at a time as the
 * average out of a number of trials.
 *
 * Both problem size and number of trials can be given as command
 * line arguments, with problems size at index 0 and trials at index 1.
 * </Answer>
 *
 * <Question> what parameters in the input could be relevant? </Question>
 *
 * <Answer>
 *      what matters most is if the array is sorted or not, the merge sort
 *      algorithm has a nLog(n) time complexity in the worst case and the
 *      insertion sort has n^2.
 *
 *      However insertion sort would sort already sorted arrays faster than
 *      mergesort, but as the result sugests in the InsertionVSMerge.pdf.
 *      Merge sort is superior insertion sort in random trials.
 * </Answer>
