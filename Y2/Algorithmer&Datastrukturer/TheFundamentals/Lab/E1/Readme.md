In C implement a recursive and an iterative version of a function which reads characters from stdin until a newline character is read and then prints them on stdout in reverse order. Hint: use getchar(), putchar() (or getc(), putc()). For the iterative version you may assume a fixed max length of the input.
Implement the above program in JAVA using one of the ADTs suggested in Algorithms ch. 1.3v
